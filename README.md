# My Advent of Code 2023 repository

The initial plan is to use this as an excuse to learn
[BQN](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/) (tagline: "finally, an APL for your
flying saucer"). I've eyed BQN for a while but have never written anything in
it. Remains to be seen whether I stick with this, or switch to a language in
which I have any clue what I'm doing.

I'm also doing some of them in bash, additionally or instead.
